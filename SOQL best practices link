1)use filters in soql like where clause, LIMIT
2)dont use soql or DML inside for loops
3)use soql for loop insread of wring soql separately above for loop that means

Good: 
for(account acc : [select id,name from account limit 45000]){

}

Bad : it cause heap size errors eventhough it retrieve less than 50 K records
list<account> acclist = select id,name from account limit 45000];
for(account acc : acclist) {
}

FOR TEST CLASSES:

Be aware that the 50k limit is an overall per-transaction limit, and not a per-query limit. Do you have other code in your test method that makes SOQL queries?
Are there at least 4 other queries with LIMIT 10000 in them? If so, that would do it. That things fail only in production, where you have more data, 
hints that this could be the case.

Also, since you mentioned that this is a test method: if any of the queries contributing to this are in logic to set up your test you may be able to 
use Test.startTest and Test.stopTest to help. Code that is run between these two methods gets a new set of limits, which means that in a scenario 
where exactly half your work is setup/teardown you can query 100k records instead.

For the sake of debugging note that you can check how many query rows have been used via Limits.getQueryRows();.
