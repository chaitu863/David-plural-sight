For picklist you can write in two ways but 1 st approach is better one
1)Select Id, Name, Description, Company, Status FROM Lead WHERE Status IN ('Working - Contacted', 'Closed - Not Converted') ORDER BY Status
2)Select Id, Name, Description, Company, Status FROM Lead WHERE Status = 'Working - Contacted' OR Status = 'Closed - Not Converted' ORDER BY Status

When you have name with single quotes at the time of writing SOQL where clause you should use \ otherwise you wont get result.
In the below exmple company name has like Rana's so write query like below
1)Select Id, Name, Description, Company, Status FROM Lead WHERE Company = 'Rana\'s'

Polymorphic Relationships
Generally task, events comes under this category because it has multiple parents with same lookup field, you can check on task object
it has whoid lookup field related to both Lead and Contact 

Select Id, Status,Who.Id, Who.Type, What.Id, What.Type, Description From Task 

-> there are soql of semi joins and empty joins but insted of those we use parent to child and child to parent query more.
we have limitation with semi joins and empty joins are we can fetch only 2 records (LIMIT 2) is max
Semi join : SELECT Id, Name, Account.Id, Account.Name FROM Contact where Accountid in (select id from account)
// if you use NOT before IN we call it empty joins
Empty join : SELECT Id, Name, Account.Id, Account.Name FROM Contact where Accountid NOT in (select id from account)
